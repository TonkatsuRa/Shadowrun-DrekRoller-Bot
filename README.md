# Shadowrun DrekRoller random table Bot
If you want to invite it to your server: 

Update to my Shadowrun DrekRoller random tables bot:
After everyone feedback mentioned slash commands, I was able to change all my commands to slash commands and make them register globally. 

You can now use /help for an interactive menu or /city and see all the autocomplete suggestions.
The bot needs new permissions for adding reactions, so I needed to create a new link: 
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1104876798648528977&permissions=9314845060160&scope=bot%20applications.commands
